description: Shared rules and per-language references for the Upbound control-plane-project skills - agent behaviour, the test-first loop, what a v2 composed resource needs, the container boundary, what a green run proves, how to report, and the KCL, Python, TypeScript, Go, go-templating and YAML references. To review a change to a control-plane project ("review this change", "review the PR", "check this work"), load it on its own and open its references/charter/review.md, where the review checks are. To do the work, load it alongside the task skill (a task skill does not load it) - author-composition for composition function code, author-tests for composition or E2E tests, author-configuration-package for scaffolding, XRDs and dependencies, verify-configuration to build, verify or run the project, e2e-test-configuration to run E2E tests, and plan-v2-migration or execute-v2-migration for a Crossplane v2 migration.

# Development Charter

**Every skill in this plugin follows this charter:** how to behave as an agent, how to
develop, what Crossplane v2 requires, and how to report what you did.

**It does not replace the task skill.** Before you write or review, load what your row
names:

| Work | Load | And read |
|---|---|---|
| reviewing | no task skill | open [`references/charter/review.md`](references/charter/review.md) now: the review checks are there, not in this file. Then the language file's failure modes for what changed (Python: `references/languages/python/pitfalls.md`; go-templating: `references/languages/go-templating.md`, "Failure modes") |
| XRD, `upbound.yaml`, dependencies, examples, ProviderConfig, MRAP | author-configuration-package | `author-configuration-package/references/mrap.md` for an MRAP |
| function code | author-composition | the language file (§10), e.g. `references/languages/go.md` (models, imports) and `references/languages/go/functions.md` |
| anything under `tests/` | author-tests | the test language's file, e.g. `references/languages/go/tests.md`, and its index beside it (`go.md`, `python.md`); an `E2ETest`: `author-tests/references/e2e.md` |
| running E2E tests, re-runs included | e2e-test-configuration | `e2e-test-configuration/references/local.md` or `space.md` beside it |

A path starting `references/` is in this skill's directory; one starting with a skill's name is
in that skill's directory, beside this one.

This file holds the rules, none of them language-specific and none optional. The evidence and
worked examples sit in [`charter/`](references/charter/), the syntax in
[`languages/`](references/languages/) (§10). Where a skill contradicts this charter, **the
charter wins**, and the skill has a bug.

**Facts these skills mark as observed or measured with up v0.55.0, or checked against its source,
were checked.** If `up version --client` (there is no `--version` flag) prints v0.55.0, use them as
stated: re-probe one only when your own run contradicts it, and report the contradiction.

---

## 1. Know which kind of agent you are

How you were started decides whether you can ask anything; every skill's mode line means this:

- **Interactive** — loaded into the user's conversation (inline): ask only what the project
  can't tell you.
- **Unattended** — handed a brief as a separate agent (forked), or no user in the loop: never
  ask; decide from the spec and state the assumption, or stop and report.

**When nobody can answer, never block on a question** — that includes a caller that cannot
relay one. Wherever a skill says to ask, read it with this rule.

**Detail:** [`charter/agent-context.md`](references/charter/agent-context.md) has what each
context may and may not do, why a fork's only output channel is prose, and how to hand work to a
sub-agent or run a long command when your harness cannot: in band and in the foreground, never
detached by you.

## 2. Discover, do not interview

**The project's own decisions win over these skills' defaults.** When the project itself
decides something differently — its XRD/API, a design document, its gate script or Makefile,
or the user — a `providerConfigRef` the platform needs, a gate script in place of a skill's
verification steps, local E2E only — follow it, and say in your report where you departed
from a skill's default and why.

| What you need | Where it is |
|---|---|
| Project root | `args`, or the nearest ancestor containing `upbound.yaml` |
| XR kind, group, version, spec schema | `apis/*/definition.yaml` |
| Existing composition + `functionRef` | `apis/*/composition.yaml` |
| Available provider families | `upbound.yaml` `spec.dependsOn` |
| Example XR shape | the file `up example generate` writes: `examples/<kind-lowercase>/<xr-name>.yaml`, the name defaulting to the lowercase Kind (`examples/network/network.yaml`, up v0.55.0). Find it; don't assume `example.yaml` |
| Composition language | `functions/*/` contents — see [`languages/`](references/languages/) |
| Test language | the `tests/*/` dirs that produce a `CompositionTest` or `E2ETest` — may differ from the composition language; with none yet, §10 picks it |
| Provider field names, types and constraints | the generated models under `.up/` |
| Current Space / group / control plane | `up ctx . --short` — how to read it: [`charter/targets.md`](references/charter/targets.md) |

Read the XRD's **defaults** before you design anything against it. `up test run` applies them
to the XR before the pipeline sees it (§8 has the limits), so a field with a `default:` reaches
your function whether the example sets it or not, and a test that asserts only what the example
mentions is asserting the XRD's defaults back to itself.

## 3. Develop test-first (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

The default flow for composition code, tests and migrations; `author-tests` owns the authoring
detail.

**Test-first is for behaviour:** the function, the composition, how status is derived.
Scaffolding, `upbound.yaml` metadata, dependencies, the XRD, an MRAP and the examples are
declarative: `up project build`, `author-configuration-package/scripts/check_xrd_schema.py` (in
that skill's directory, not a project path) and the composition tests that use them check
those. Write no test program for them, and don't copy a skill's script into the project.

**Why:** watching a test fail first makes a coverage claim checkable.

### The loop

1. **RED — write the test, run it, and read the failure.**

   ```bash
   up test run "tests/<t>"      # expect: FAIL
   ```

   Run it directly, not through `verify-configuration`, which builds the package and runs the
   whole suite.

   **A failure is only RED if it fails for the reason you intended.** Check the message:

   | Failure | Verdict |
   |---|---|
   | `no actual resource found` for the resource you are about to compose, or for one whose annotation you are adding | valid RED |
   | a field mismatch naming the exact field you are adding | valid RED |
   | a syntax error, an unresolved import, a missing `compositionPath`, a run that stops at `✗ Parsing tests`, a bug in the test's own logic | **not** RED, even though it exits 1 — the test is broken, not the code. Fix it before writing any implementation |
   | a compiled language (Go): `undefined: <symbol you are adding>` | **not** RED — a compile error. Add a stub that only returns the zero value, then watch the assertion fail; a stub that already does the work never shows RED |
   | passes immediately | **not** RED — the assertion is vacuous, or the behaviour already exists |
   | E2E: an implementation mutation (drop a composed resource others depend on, break a selector) that never readies within a short `timeoutSeconds` | valid RED, and optional (below). Editing `defaultConditions` or an expected value is not; an unparsable condition is a broken test (author-tests' `e2e.md` reference) |

   Filling in a generated name or the rendered `resourceRefs` order after GREEN completes an
   expectation whose RED you already saw. It is not editing an expected value
   ([`charter/evidence.md`](references/charter/evidence.md)).

   Record the failure text: your report cites it as evidence that the test bites.

   **RED is required for composition tests and function unit tests, and optional for a new
   `E2ETest`.** An e2e RED costs a real control-plane run: take it when it is cheap, as in the
   table's last row; otherwise report the E2ETest as unproven (§4).

2. **GREEN — implement** until the test passes, and no further.

3. **REFACTOR** with the suite green, then add the next failing assertion and repeat.

**Use distinguishing inputs.** Every value the function passes through gets, in at least one
test, an input that is neither its default nor shared with a sibling field, or a hard-coded
constant stays green (author-tests Phase 3). For a pass-through field, expected == input is
correct; prove it by hard-coding the field in the function and seeing a test go red, never by
editing the expectation.

**Detail:** [`charter/tdd.md`](references/charter/tdd.md) has the two-tier inner loop (every
`up test run` pays a full build, so use a fast tier for crashes), and how to backfill tests for
code that already works by proving each one can fail: mutate the implementation, never the
test's expected value.

## 4. Report the effect, not the intent

An overstated report asserts what the change was *meant* to do instead of reading back what it
*did*.

Before writing any summary:

1. **Name what you ran**, and its exit code — the command's own. After
   `up test run … | tail -20`, `$?` is `tail`'s, not `up`'s. Redirect, then read `$?`
   (`up test run "tests/test-*" > /tmp/t.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"`), or, after a pipe, read
   `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` in bash or `$pipestatus[1]` in zsh, straight after it.
2. **Re-read the evidence you are about to paste** and check it does not contradict your
   verdict.
3. **Distinguish the layers.** A render is not an install; an install is not a provider
   accepting the resource; `Ready=True` is not the provider holding the value you meant.
   Say which layer you reached.
4. **When you did not verify something, say so plainly.** "Not verified at the provider" is
   a useful report. A checkmark you cannot support is not.
5. **A coverage claim is a claim about what would fail.** Before writing "covers X",
   "complete", or "N/N", answer: *what change to the code would make this go red?* If you
   cannot name one, you have not covered X — you have written something that passes.
6. **Drop the checkmark register.** `✅ Complete`, `PASS`, and a tidy summary table read as
   verification whatever is behind them, which is what makes an overstated report
   persuasive. Write what ran, what it printed, and what remains unknown. If the honest
   summary is "tests pass; provider validity unchecked; not deployed", that is the summary:
   more useful to the caller than a confident one that is wrong. A skill's success criteria
   are checks for you, not a report format: do not tick them off in a report.
7. **Comments, docs and READMEs claim no more than a named test or run.** They are read as
   reports.

## 5. Crossplane v2: what a composed resource actually needs

**When the project's API exposes these fields** — an XRD with `managementPolicies` or a
`providerConfigName` parameter, as many platform configurations do — pass them to every managed
resource (MR) from the first one you write, have the E2E test create the ProviderConfig the
reference names (author-tests' `e2e.md`), and say so in your report. How a review judges these
fields: [`charter/review.md`](references/charter/review.md).

**These rules are for a v2 project.** The XRDs' `apiVersion` says which one you have, not the
template a project came from: `up project init`'s cloud templates are v1 and its k8s-webapp
template is v2 (§10). A v1 project keeps its v1 APIs and its Kinds; migrating it is separate
work (`plan-v2-migration`).

### API groups and versions

Compositions target the `.m.` provider API groups (`.m.` means *modern*, not "naMespaced":
[`charter/v2-resources.md`](references/charter/v2-resources.md)).

| Aspect | Use this | Not this |
|---|---|---|
| Managed resource `apiVersion` | `<service>.<cloud>.m.upbound.io/v1beta1` (Upbound providers) or `<...>.m.crossplane.io/v1beta1` (community) | the same group without `.m.` |
| A new XRD | `apiextensions.crossplane.io/v2` + `scope: Namespaced`; Kind without an `X` prefix, no `claimNames` | `v1`, cluster-scoped, `claimNames` |
| **Composition** | **stays `apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1`** | there is no `v2` Composition — do not bump it |

### Set `forProvider`, and stop

Crossplane v2 fills in the rest; "required v2 fields" the project did not ask for can break the
resource.

| Field | Do you set it? (the default; the project may override) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata.namespace` | **No** | A namespaced XR's namespace overwrites it; only a cluster-scoped XR's resources keep the one the function sets |
| `managementPolicies` | **No** | The CRD defaults it to `["*"]`; never write that yourself. Set it only for another policy (orphan on delete) or when the project's API exposes it |
| `deletionPolicy` | **No** | A namespaced MR has no such field; orphan with `managementPolicies` |
| `providerConfigRef` | Omit it if and only if `ClusterProviderConfig/default` exists and is the right one | The CRD defaults it to `ClusterProviderConfig/default` |
| `metadata.name` | Only for a stable external name | Otherwise generated: deterministic in a render (safe to assert), not across re-creations |
| `crossplane.io/composition-resource-name` | Never by hand | It comes from the key you store the resource under |
| `writeConnectionSecretToRef` | **Yes, on every resource whose connection details the function reads** | Crossplane hands a composed resource's connection details to the function only from the Secret this names. Without it they arrive empty, and no render shows the difference |

**Never let a missing connection detail fall back to a value.** They are empty until the
provider has written that Secret, and always empty without the reference above, so a default
(`""`, `None`) publishes a Secret with an empty password that looks like success. Compose the
Secret only once every value it needs is present.

**The table is about the composed resource's own metadata, not about objects inside
`forProvider`.** A Kubernetes object embedded in a managed resource — the `manifest` of a
provider-kubernetes `Object`, for instance — is input to the provider, and nothing fills in its
namespace. Set it explicitly, normally to the XR's namespace: without it a provider-kubernetes
`Object` stays `Synced=False` with `an empty namespace may not be set when a resource name is
provided` (v1.3.3), and composition tests that assert the same omission stay green.

**Detail:** [`charter/v2-resources.md`](references/charter/v2-resources.md) has the verified
behaviour behind each table row, what these CRD defaults do to a render (it differs by
language), how connection details reach a function and how to catch a missing one, when a
`providerConfigRef` is warranted, what a missing or wrong ProviderConfig
looks like on a control plane, and the two greps that catch a hardcoded one.

### The XRD

**Write the XRD yourself** rather than inferring it from an example with `up xrd generate`: an
example carries values, never constraints, so an inferred schema loses every `required:`,
`default:`, open-ended map and `status` field you meant to have.
[`charter/v2-resources.md`](references/charter/v2-resources.md) has the v2 skeleton and what
inference does to the generated model.

**Then design the schema, do not just transcribe fields;** most of it is permanent from the
first version that ships. [`charter/xrd-design.md`](references/charter/xrd-design.md) has why,
the rules, the CEL patterns, and the `--dry-run=server` loop that proves them.

## 6. The provider schema is a lower bound, not the constraint set

Namespaced APIs and `forProvider`-only are *Crossplane* correctness; they say nothing about
whether the provider accepts the resource, and a composition test passes either way.

**Check every Kind you compose against its provider.** Read the conditional rules the
generated models record in docstrings and field descriptions (`Required if …`, `Conflicts
with …`): optional in the type means only that the CRD does not require it. Then check the
cloud API's own rules (name formats, reserved prefixes, create-only fields), and treat *one
list element → one object* as a decision you justify, not the default.

State the result in your summary: which Kinds you checked, what the schema required, and
which API-level rule you could not confirm. "I checked and found nothing" is a valid result.
Silently skipping is not.

**Detail:** [`charter/provider-schema.md`](references/charter/provider-schema.md) has examples
(an S3 lifecycle rule that renders and fails with `MalformedXML`), the measured hit rates, the
one docstring that is always a false positive, and the rule classes only the cloud API docs
hold.

## 7. The container boundary

`up test run` runs the test program of every directory it matches before any test, with or
without `--e2e` (up v0.55.0). **Go and go-templating test programs run locally and see your
full environment (Go through `os.Getenv`, go-templating through Sprig's `env`); KCL and Python
programs run in a container that sees only `UP_*` variables and no `~/.aws`.** Name
every test input `UP_*`, and run the composition gate as `up test run "tests/test-*"`: one e2e
program that exits non-zero — on a missing input, say — fails a plain `tests/*` run at
`✗ Parsing tests`. `no valid CompositionTests found` means the matched dirs produced no
`CompositionTest` (e.g. `e2etest-*` without `--e2e`): a wrong glob, not a failing test. **An e2e
program's output carries its credential Secret:** run one by hand only with a dummy `UP_*` value,
and never print or save it with real ones (author-tests' `e2e.md`).

**Detail:** [`charter/container.md`](references/charter/container.md) has the per-language
table, the `UP_` credential route, the E2E command and the README note, and the tighter second
boundary around function rendering.

## 8. A green run is not evidence

| Green thing | What it actually proves |
|---|---|
| `up project build` | the package was assembled, never that the function *runs*. Only Go compiles here; what each language's build checks: [`charter/evidence.md`](references/charter/evidence.md#what-a-clean-up-project-build-checks) |
| `up test run` printing `No test files found`, or an `--e2e` run printing `Total Tests Executed: 0` | **nothing ran.** No test was collected, and it exits 0 anyway — that is not a pass. `--e2e` over directories that produce no `E2ETest` (a `test-*` glob, or a program emitting only `CompositionTest`s) builds the whole package, runs nothing and exits 0 (up v0.55.0). A test directory that emits no `CompositionTest`, such as a Go test program printing `items: []`, contributes zero tests; next to real tests it just drops out of the count. Report "no tests ran". |
| A composition test suite | the assertions you wrote held against the render. `assertResources` is **partial and positive for objects**: it ignores composed resources it does not list, and within a resource it checks only the fields you name, at every depth. **Lists are the exception** — an asserted list must match the rendered one exactly in length *and* order, or you get `lengths of slices don't match`. A short list assertion is not a weak assertion; it is a failing one. |
| A render | the function produced objects. Not that the API server accepts them, and not that the provider does. |
| `Ready=True` | the provider reconciled *something*. Read back the field you meant, from the live object, not from the input manifest. |

**A generated test proves nothing until you fill it in.** `up test generate`'s stub has empty
paths and fails before any assertion: a **broken test, not RED** (§3;
[`charter/generators.md`](references/charter/generators.md)). With the paths filled in, an
`assertResources` list you never populated is green and means nothing.

A filled-in single test is not much better: one input shape, asserting only composed
resources, passes over a function that crashes on a minimal XR and drops three of four status
fields.

**Observed-state branches are reachable, and you are expected to reach them.** A render starts
with no observed resources *unless the test supplies `spec.observedResources`*. So code gated
on observed-and-ready is dead in a test that omits that field and live in one that sets it —
write the second test rather than declaring the branch untestable. A mock is matched by its
composition-resource-name annotation, and for a namespaced XR needs the XR's namespace: without
it the mock is silently ignored. Its own name replaces the generated one
([`charter/evidence.md`](references/charter/evidence.md), Coverage). Such a test proves your
branch logic given the status you wrote, not that a provider ever reports that status. For
that, `--e2e` or a live apply — or say it is unverified.

The XRD defaulting in §2 has two limits:

- **Only if the test sets `xrdPath` (or inline `xrd`).** Without it the XR is rendered exactly
  as written and no defaulting happens at all.
- **The XR only.** Composed resources are never touched by this. Provider *CRD* defaults are a
  different mechanism — see §5.

**Detail:** [`charter/evidence.md`](references/charter/evidence.md) has why an
`_output/composition_test/` directory your run didn't print is stale, how `assertResources` matches
a resource, asserting `spec.crossplane.resourceRefs` so a surplus resource fails the suite, and
what a suite must contain (minimal XR, observed-state branches, status on the composite).

## 9. Never create infrastructure as a side effect

A group, a Space, a control plane or a published package is the user's decision. Running what
you were asked to run — an E2E test, `up project run` — is not a side effect; anything you add
to make it work is.

- **Never create a group, Space or control plane to make a command work.**
- **Never let the context choose the target silently.** Read it with `up ctx . --short`, or
  pass `--local`; a local KIND result is not a Space result.
- **Never pass `--public` on your own initiative.** It publishes the user's package — an
  irreversible disclosure, never a debugging step.
- **Never pass a `--kubeconfig` you did not write and check in this run.**
- **Delete what this run created, and nothing else.** Your own leftovers — a control plane, a
  kind cluster and its registry container, a scratch directory — must be removed before
  you report; for anything else, report what you would delete and let the user choose.
- **Delete a control plane only once no managed resource is left on it.** Deleting it first
  leaves their cloud resources running, tracked by nothing: delete the XRs, wait until
  `kubectl get managed -A` is empty, and if that hangs, keep the control plane and report what
  remains ([`charter/targets.md`](references/charter/targets.md), Teardown and leftovers).

**Abort on a failed precondition; do not proceed and report the symptom.** A check that
comes back *blocked* — not merely *failed* — means the run you are about to start cannot
produce a valid result. Starting it anyway spends real time on a failure whose cause you
already knew.

**Detail:** [`charter/targets.md`](references/charter/targets.md) — read it before a run on a
Space, or one without a target flag (a `--local` E2E run reads e2e-test-configuration's
`local.md` instead) — has which control plane a run lands on, how to read `up ctx`, how the
group defaults to `default`, why a bad `--kubeconfig` silently goes local, what `--public`
does and does not change, diagnosing `context deadline exceeded`, and teardown.

---

## 10. Language dispatch

Detect the composition language from `functions/` and the test language from `tests/` — separate
axes, which a project may mix — with the table in
[`languages/README.md`](references/languages/README.md), then read the file it names. **New tests
use the language of the existing tests, else the composition language if `up` tests in it, else
YAML**; a program that emits no `CompositionTest` or `E2ETest` (a Go program printing
`items: []`) is not a test and sets nothing
([why, and the flags](references/languages/README.md#choosing-the-test-language-for-new-tests)).

**Detail:** [`charter/generators.md`](references/charter/generators.md) has the `--language`
slugs and what each generator emits: which `up project init` templates are v1 and which v2,
and how to tell from the XRD, how `up xrd generate` drops every constraint, and the embedded
`functionRef` name formula (and the `unknown function` it explains).
